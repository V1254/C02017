Networking:

Service:
	- A set of primitives that a layer provides to the layer above it.
	
Protocol:
	- A set of rules governing the format and semantics of data exchanged
	by layers of the same level.

Flooding:
	Routing network traffic to every node in a network by re-broadcasting every incoming packet
	to every available outgoing connection.
	
Four layers of TCP/IP Model:
|	- Application
|	- Transport
|	- Internet
V	- Network

OSI Mode:
	- Application
	- Presentation
	- Session
	- Transport
	- Network
	- Data link
	- Physical


Used in cases wherre most traffic will be of interest to large proportion of the nodes.
	-> streaming of live events as an example.
	
Prevention of Filling Up:
	-> hop-counter on each packet of data.
	-> decrement counter after every re-broadcast
	-> drop packets with 0 hop counters.
	
Three Way Handshake:
	-> A sends a conenction request to B with a sequence numbers.
	-> B sends an acknowledgment back including A and B's sequence number.
	-> A sends first data, plus both sequence numbers.

Open Shortest Path First  Protocol:
	-> used by routers within an area(subnet) to communicate so that they can keep routing tables up to date.
	-> Flooding is used by each router to transmit its state.
	-> Each router gets dynamic information about the connectivity and costs of other routers
	in the same area using link state protocol messages.
	-> Each router then collects this data and uses dijkstras algorithm to construct
	its own routing table.
	
	
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol vs Exterior Gateway Routiung protocol:
	-> network is divided into multiple autonomous systems.
	-> interior gateway routing protocol operates within an autonomous system.
	-> each will generally have detailed routing knowledge within the system and can use the simplest
	and most effiecient routing (usually backbone connecting areas).
	-> Each AS is connected to others via Boundary routers which operate using the
	exterior gateway routing protocol.
	-> this protocol routes traffic to the correct boundary router, but may take other
	non-functional criteria(traffic type etc.) into account.
	
Transport Layers services for the network layer:
	-> adds network services for individual processes on a host.
	-> network sockets gives connection endpoints addresses that are connected to
	individual processes.


Physical layer:
	-> transmission hardware
	-> Guided: (cable & fibre optics)
	-> Unguided: radio & lasers.
	
Data link layer:
	-> transmit data reliably over non-reliable channels.
	-> software for effective transmission of bits
	
	
Network Layer function:
	-> translates logical network addresses into physical addresses. 
	-> essentially responsible for delivering datagrams from source to destination.
	-> uses the Internet protocol.
	
Transport layer function:
	-> allows peers entities to carry on a establish communication channel
	-> Uses TCP/UDP protocols.
	
Application layer function:
	-> contains application-oriented protocols.	
	
TCP :
	-> connection-oriented protocol
	-> provides reliable service over unreliable internetwork.
	-> designed to adapt to network conditions and deal with various sorts of errors.
	
UDP :
	-> simple connectionless protocol
	-> adds only transport header to ip.
	-> used by single request/response applications.
	
	
Connection-oriented examples: File Transfer & Remote Login
Connectionless examples: database queries.
